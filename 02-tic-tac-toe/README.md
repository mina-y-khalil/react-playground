# Setting Up and Running the Project

## 1. Install Dependencies

First, install all the required third-party packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the project in the browser so you can see it in action.
